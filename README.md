# Code Utilities
Hey! This is a repository containing a .sk and a .jar file, made for your minecraft server.
THESE ARE NOT THE SAME! They are all ENTIRELY different, and so we do not recommend you to install both plugins/files as it may break stuff.

# Difference between .sk and .jar:

.sk requires the plugin "Skript" and its other addons listed in its skript releases.

.jar just requires you putting it in your "plugins" folder.
