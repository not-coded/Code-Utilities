# Code Utilities

This is the Code Utilities plugin!

Note: THESE ARE NOT THE SAME! They are all ENTIRELY different, and so we do not recommend you to install both plugins/files as it may break stuff.

CRITICAL: If you have an older version of Code-Utilities, then please delete the config file.

Warning: Please do not install 2 (or more) versions of Code-Utilities (Skript or Plugin), as it may break stuff.

## Difference between .sk and .jar:

.sk requires the plugin "Skript" and the other addons listed in its skript releases.

.jar just requires you putting it in your "plugins" folder.
